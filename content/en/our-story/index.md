Who We Are

It all began with a casual post on Xiao Hong Shu in the summer of 2023. Our first session, a small kickabout on 1st Oct 2023, drew 16 participants. Since then, our group has burgeoned from 16 to 119 members, and we've been tirelessly kicking around on the pitch every Saturday.

Fuelled by our growing passion for the game, Screamer Alliance WFC was set up in March 2024. We named our club "Screamer Alliance" to celebrate the infectious laughter and camaraderie we share on the field. In just two months, we've evolved into a football club that hosts three weekly sessions, fields two teams, and boasts over 60 registered members.

Our Vision:

- Enhance fitness and mental well-being within our community.
- Foster opportunities for coach and player development.
- Cultivate bonds, friendships, and empower women.
- Champion visibility for East Asian females in football.

Our sessions are designed to accommodate all skill levels, balancing social play with competitive spirit. As newcomers to London, these football sessions have provided us with a platform to connect with like-minded individuals and forge unique bonds.

Our mission is to dismantle barriers for East Asian women in football. We strive to create safe spaces where women can explore, grow, and challenge themselvesâ€”both on the pitch and in life. It's all about joy, passion, and community.
